    <h1>What is Composer?</h1>
    <p>Composer helps you manage your project or libraries' dependencies. You can find the Composer source on <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h1>Declaring dependencies</h1>
    <p>To define your project's dependencies, you can use a composer.json file, just like in a library or plugin, but you don't have to specify the package name or most of the other fields.</p>
    <p>A typical composer.json file for a project looks like this:
<pre>
{
    "require": {
      "monolog": "1.0.0"
    }
}
</pre>
    In this example, the project only requires the Monolog library as a dependency.</p>
    <p>You can add different repositories than Packagist, if needed, by specifying them by hand. For example git repositories can be used as repositories if they contain a composer.json, even if the packages are not available on Packagist. They could also be private repositories that you don't want to make accessible to everyone. Here's how to do it:
<pre>
{
    "repositories": {
        "MyRepo": {
            "git": "git://example.org/MyRepo.git"
        }
    },
    "require": {
        "monolog": "1.0.0",
        "mypackage": ">=1.0.0"
    }
}
</pre></p>
